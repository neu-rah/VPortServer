VPortServer
===========

VirtualPort I2C Server (experimental)

Allow local ports/pins and locally defined VirtualPins to be used over I2C network
using VirtualPins client

This works well for a passive server with only one client
Still we need to share the local hardware ports as SPI and Serial...
